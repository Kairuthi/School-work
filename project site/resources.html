        <h2>Helpful Resources and Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <p>Whether you're a new cat owner or an experienced one, here are some tips and answers to common questions about adopting and caring for your feline friend.</p>

        <div class="faq-section">
            <h3>Adoption FAQs</h3>
            
            <h4>Q: How long does the adoption process take?</h4>
            <p>A: The average time from submitting the application to taking your cat home is 5-10 business days. This allows time for background checks, veterinary reference calls, and the final meet-and-greet.</p>

            <h4>Q: What is included in the adoption fee?</h4>
            <p>A: The fee covers the cat's spay/neuter surgery, all age-appropriate vaccinations, deworming, microchipping, and a starter bag of their current food. Our goal is to ensure your cat is healthy and ready for their new life.</p>

            <h4>Q: Can I return the cat if it doesn't work out?</h4>
            <p>A: We offer a two-week transition period. If for any reason the placement isn't successful, we require the cat to be returned directly to Paws Adoption. We are committed to the lifetime care of our cats.</p>
