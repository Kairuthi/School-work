        <h2>Our Story: Dedicated to Feline Welfare</h2>
        
        <div class="mission-statement">
            <p>"To provide every abandoned and stray cat with a path to a loving, safe, and permanent home through dedicated care, community education, and responsible placement."</p>
        </div>

        <h3>How Pawsome Adoption Began</h3>
        <p>Pawsome Cat Adoption was founded in **2020** by a small group of passionate volunteers who saw a critical need for a high-quality, no-kill shelter in the Purrville area. We started as a network of dedicated foster homes and, thanks to community support, grew into our current small, volunteer-run facility.</p>
        
        <p>We believe every cat deserves a second chance, regardless of age, breed, or medical history. Our priority is matching cats with owners whose lifestyles and expectations align with the cat's specific needs.</p>
