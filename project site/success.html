                <h3>Ginger Finds Her happy home</h3>
                <p><strong>Adopted by: Nyaga</strong></p>
                <p>"Ginger (now named Boots) has settled in beautifully! She spends her days sunbathing by the window and is the sweetest companion. Thank you for bringing her into our lives; she is perfect with the kids."</p>

                <p><strong>Adopted by: Kyama</strong></p>
                <p>"Shadow (now 'Midnight') is exactly the energetic playmate I needed. He keeps me entertained all evening, and he and my older cat are slowly becoming friends. The application process was thorough but worth it!"</p>
